            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And now in my Text this is evidently carried, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Covenant to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> was intended not for him only, but for all Believers, as Heirs with him of the ſame Promiſe; and that God gave the Promiſe to them, and ſware to them in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, and ſwearing to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that ſo by giving them his Word and Oath</p>

            <p>This Doctrine is clearly offered from the Text, for if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> were not intended for, and belonging to Believers in after Generations, then the confirmation of it to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had not tended to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of New-Teſtament Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as here this is expreſſed to be the end of God's Oath to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> that we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (this is (as I ſaid) a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription or paraphraſe of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.)</p>

This ſhort expreſſion carries in it all the Covenant of Promiſe, which God gave from the firſt man to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of Chriſt; it is (as one ſaith) the Epitome or ſum of the whole Goſpel; it is God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of pardon and peace, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:137310:10"/>and life, of Juſtification, and Sanctification, and Salvation, of all grace and bleſſing here and hereafter. This is the ſubſtance of the Covenant, and it is ſubſtantial indeed, hath ſubſtance enough in it.</p>

               <note place="margin">Covenant confirmed, how?</note>It is confirmed by Gods Word, and Oath, and Seals, and by the Death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 We have God's Word, his written Word, to ſhew for it; he hath given it us under his hand in many places of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is God's Oath for the confirmation of the Covenant; his Oath to Chriſt, <hi>The Lord ſware,</hi>

            <p n="4">4 The Covenant is confirmed by the Death of Chriſt: He was appointed to be the Mediator of the Covenant, to mediate as a Surety, and he hath mediated by Bloud, hath fulfilled the Law of a Redeemer, and fully anſwered his engagement of Suretiſhip; ſo that God cannot now in Juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any thing that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give, nor refuſe to do

            <p>Chriſt having died according to that agreement betwixt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him, is to be ſatisfied for his dying, as well as by his death he hath ſatisfied his Father; now nothing will ſatisfie Chriſt but to have the end of his death, which is, that they for whom he died be juſtified and ſaved;<note place="margin">

            <p>Now by the Seals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, I underſtand the New Teſtament Sacraments, which are God's Seals confirming his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to his covenanted ones.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:137310:22"/>
            <p>Divines do generally affirm the Sacraments to be ſeals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Promiſe; this is in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry definition, and it is the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Opinion, and concurrent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Orthodox, agreeable to the Word of God, that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are inſtituted to ſignifie and ſeal up to us Goſpel Grace, ſerving to ſtrongthen our Faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, being ſeals of the Covenant of Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Now where God gives his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he gives his ſeal for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; ſo that all in Covenant have a right to the ſeals or ſeal of the Covenant, and none but they; ſo that to give the ſeal to thoſe that have no Covenant given them, is indeed to ſet a ſeal to a blank, (that which Anabaptiſts do frivolouſly urge againſt the baptizing of Infants) and to deny the Seal where the Covenant is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is very injurious, and a great ſin againſt God, and his covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones.</p>
            <p>I do not now make it my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs particularly and fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:137310:22"/>how far the right to the ſeals extendeth, nor within what compaſs it is to be limitted as to particular ſubjects, I do only now draw up a general inference from the Doctrine, inferring thence the extent of ſuch a right to all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſeed, and the limitation of it to this ſeed only, as having an intereſt in the Covenant; and my drift herein is, to ſhew how our Doctrine and inference from it lays a clear ground for Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, for the baptizing of Inſants in the Church of Chriſt: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the ſeal of the Covenant, belongs to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, who are included in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Heirs of the ſame Promiſe.</p>

            <p n="1">1 You muſt have eyes to ſee what you take, muſt not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Covenant which is to be applyed; we ſay a blind man may catch a Hare (it is poſſible, though not probable) but a blind ignorant ſoul cannot apply the Covenant of Promiſe; as it is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulouſly reported of <hi>Ixion,</hi> that he imbraced a dusky dark Cloud inſtead of bright beautiful <hi>June:</hi>

            <p n="2">2 You muſt apply the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as God's Covenant of Grace offered to ſinners.</p>
            <p>There are three ſpecialties in this to be taken notice of.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 It is God's Covenant.</item>
               <item>2 A Covenant of Grace.</item>
               <item>3 A Covenant offered to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1 It is God's Covenant, not mans; and ſeeing it is God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</p>
            <p n="1">It is worth the laying hold on, for God doth not covenant to give to the Heirs of Promiſe ſmall petty things, but great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters indeed:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> The Apoſtle ſaith, that God hath given us exceeding great and precious promiſes; ſuch are the things promiſed to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, exceeding great and precious.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:137310:28"/>God gives like himſelf, gifts wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the giver; Gods Covenant of Promiſe is the riches and treaſure of the heirs of promiſe.</p>
            <p>This is one conſideration to draw us in to the Covenant, to make us deſirous of it; it is worth the having.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Seeing it is God's Covenant, we may be ſure it ſhall be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A mans covenant with God or man may be broken, becauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may be unable to make it good, or he may prove falſe and deceitful: (and oh what falſhood is there found with men, and how common a ſin is covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?) but now we cannot queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's performance:</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe there can be no want of power for the fulfilling of his Covenant; <hi>To thee, O Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 62.11.</note>
               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lougeth Power.</hi> We are taught in the Lord's prayer to aſcribe this unto God, <hi>Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power.</hi> God is Almighty, ſo that there cannot be any check given to his Power by the greateſt difficulty that can be imagined;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:137310:29"/>there is nothing too hard for God to do, nothing at all difficult to him: Hereby <hi>Abraham</hi> his Faith in the Promiſes was born up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was perſwaded that what God had promiſed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21.</note> he was able to perform.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There can be no failing of God's truth and faithfulneſs; he is not as man, that he ſhould lye, nor as the ſon of man that he ſhould repent;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dent.</hi> 32.4.</note>
               <hi>The Lord is a God of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations will make the ſoul deſirous to apply the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, when it conſiders, that it is Gods Covenant, and a covenant concerning very great matters, and a covenant that ſhall ſurely be performed by the Almighty, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, unchangeable God. And as this conſideration may ſerve to draw the ſoul to the Covenant, ſo it may give direction, and be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, reſpecting the right manner of applying it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If it be the Covenant of God, it is to be applyed humbly, and with ſelf-denial, and ſelf-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement; O Lord, I would have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:137310:29"/>it, I deſire to cloſe with it, but truly I am moſt unworthy of it: Bleſſed and glorious God, what am I that thou ſhould'ſt tender to me the covenant of thy love?</p>
            <p n="2">2 If it be God's Covenant concerning great and precious things that he will give, then it is to be applyed earneſtly: We are too earneſt and greedy to catch at the things of the world (which we look upon as great matters, though they are not ſo indeed) Oh if we did underſtand the things which concern the wealth, and peace, and happineſs of our ſouls, then we ſhould be as earneſt to lay hold on the riches of God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the good things therein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, which are great matters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If it be the covenant of God Almighty, and unchangeable, who abideth faithful for ever, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it fiducially, without ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the promiſe, as being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the performance.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the firſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, (it is God's covenant.)</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:137310:30"/>
            <p>The ſecond ſpecialty to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of in the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule of direction is this.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is God's covenant <hi>(of Grace)</hi> this is to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Now this conſideration will be of ſpecial uſe in the application of the Covenant. Nothing moved God at firſt to make this Covenant, but his own goodneſs, herein he expreſſed his love, and diſcovered his free grace, which was the ground of the Covenant; and truly that is it which carries it on to full accompliſhment, by every ſtep, and in every parcel of it: The whole buſineſs of ſaving from firſt to laſt, is meerly of grace. Now ſee what a direction and help this will be in the application of the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If it be a Covenant of Grace, then we muſt go out of our ſelves to take it, and muſt take it wholly as a Covenant of Grace: I ſay, we muſt go out of our ſelves, <hi>i.e.</hi> we muſt be taken off from our own bottom, ſo as to have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our ſelves, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:137310:30"/>of our own worthineſs; we muſt come off from our graces and duties, from our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, muſt have no Opinion of that, though the work of grace in us, clear to us, may be our warrant to apply the Covenant to our ſelves, when we find this effect of the Covenant in our own ſouls, this condition of enjoying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yet our graces and duties muſt not be lookt upon, as giving us any right to it, or rendering us any way worthy of it; no, it muſt be a ſelf-denying application, taking it by Faith, as purely from grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This conſideration (that it is a Covenant of Grace) will help to carry on the ſelf-judging, ſelf-condemning ſoul, to an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
            <p>A precious ſweet Covenant (ſaith a poor heart that hath a ſight of its own ſinfulneſs and vileneſs) oh it is a bleſſedneſs to have an intereſt in it, but I vile wretch am unworthy; what have I to do with the Covenant of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:137310:31"/>great and holy God? it belongeth to holy ones, to thoſe that have better hearts then I have, and are more in duty then I am, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties in a better manner then I do, and that have greater abilities to ſerve and glorifie God.</p>
            <p>Now let ſuch a ſoul conſider the freeneſs of the grace of God in the Covenant: Doſt thou judge thy ſelf before the Lord, and mourn over the corruption, and carnality, and lazineſs, and barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deadneſs of thy heart? Doſt thou bewail thy unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unprofitableneſs, and thy backwardneſs to holy duties, and thy miſcarriages in them? Are thy ſins thy ſouls burden, and thy weakneſſes the matter of thy grief and complaint? Why? to thee the Covenant doth belong, which is a Covenant concerning Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as Juſtification, and a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, holding forth the mercy and goodneſs of God to thoſe that have need of it, and not to thoſe that deſerve it: The good God gives his Covenant as a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:137310:31"/>[gift of grace] to all thoſe whom he takes into Covenant; therefore let humble ſouls, broken-hearted ſinners ariſe, and go to God, who calls them, and holds forth grace to them in his Covenant.</p>
            <p>There is yet a third ſpecialty in our ſecond general rule of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he that would rightly apply the Covenant muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This Covenant is a Covenant offered to ſinners, to thoſe to whom the poyſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature is propagated, and by whom much ſin hath been act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſuch as are full of ſin, and loaden with guilt, even to Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Harlots, to a <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> to a <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is held out to ſuch, if they come in by repentance, and bring Faith to lay hold on it:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, for he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

            <p>You have ſeen a ſecond rule that is to be obſerved by thoſe who deſire duly to apply the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>Remember that it is God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace offered to ſinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That you may not miſapply the Covenant, or catch at that which belongs not to you, keep this in mind, That [God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made only to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed.] Now <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, children of Promiſe, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſame Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> are (in general) all the Elect; but God's Election is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret which cannot be known, <hi>à priori,</hi> but only by God himſelf, who alone knows who are his, yet we may have a knowledge of it <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> when we find that we are called with a holy and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al calling. Now I ſay you muſt apply the Covenant, as being <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:137310:33"/>and intereſt in his precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or elſe you do not apply the Covenant truly and honeſtly, but unjuſtly, laying a falſe claim to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As we muſt make God in his Covenant our end, ſo we muſt make Chriſt, as Mediator, our way; and therefore in applying the Covenant muſt look to him, and act Faith primarily on him, by whom the grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is purchaſed for us, and in and through whom it is conveyed to us; we muſt accept of Chriſt for our Lord and Jeſus, that we may receive the Covenant of Grace, and Peace, and ſalvation through him.</p>
            <p n="5">5 We muſt know, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is propounded and offered conditionally, Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and New Obedience, are the condition of Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>It is certain none are ſaved but by Covenant, by a Covenant of Grace, but it is by the Covenant kept; therefore I muſt not think
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:137310:34"/>without any more ado, to take this Covenant to my ſelf, not having any regard to the fulfilling of the condition of the Covenant in my ſelf; where there is not Faith and Repentance, a true worke of grace and holineſs, there can be no right application of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>So much now as to the firſt branch of the fourth General Counſel, Apply the Covenant tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

            <p>Seeing there is ſuch a Covenant of Grace ſo precious, and ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us, which belongs to the feed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why ſhould we be content to live without aſſurance of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in it? They who are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are for Heaven, and they that are out of Covenant, are for Hell. Oh how deſirous ſhould we then be, to be reſolved and aſſured whether we be in Covenant or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:137310:34"/>no? How can we think or ſpeak of God with comfort, or without fear and trouble in our ſpirits, while we are uncertain whether he be our God or no, whether he be our friend or our enemy: Let us labour therefore to be at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in this point; an infallible certainty of our intereſt in God's Covenant may be had: Oh let us ſtrive to it.</p>
            <p>Now to quicken you in this caſe, to excite you to diligence in making up to a thorow applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's Covenant, even to the full aſſurance of Faith, I ſhall hint to you ſomething of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and comfort of aſſurance, the unſpeakable advantage that hence accrues to the ſoul.<note place="margin">Fruits of aſſurance.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 This aſſurance of Faith will ſweeten to us all Providences, and every condition of life,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18.</note> while a Chriſtian lives by Faith in a clear apprehenſion of the love of God, who hath made an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, no outward changes can work any great change in his ſpirit, or make much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:137310:35"/>preſſion upon him; aſſurance of God's love will make a Chriſtian to ſit down under changes, quietly and comfortably, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> rejoycing in the Lord, and joying in the God of his ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Aſſurance of God's love will ſweeten to us our enjoyments in the world, be it more or leſs that we have of theſe things, if it be but a little Oyl in the Cruſe, and a hand-full of meal in the Barrel, aſſurance of a Covenant intereſt in God will make it enough to us, and render it good; for want of this poor hearts are full of fears, and cares, and diſcontents, even in the midſt of abundance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things which they poſſeſs; but this (I ſay) will ſweeten our enjoyments to us; for being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God, we know that what we have comes from love, and is a pledge of greater love, and is that which our God ſees to be good for us, and is bleſſed to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This aſſurance will give the foul boldneſs to come unto God,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:137310:35"/>and make it familiar with him, and much ſweeten and heighten Communion: This will fill us with comfort in our approaches to the Throne of Grace, when we can confidently call God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Am I in great ſtraights, or do I lye under ſome ſore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? is this, or that wanting to me? what a comfort is it now, that I have a God to go to, a God in Covenant with me that can ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and deliver me, that can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my wants, and is able to do for me exceeding abundantly, above all that I can ask or think.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Aſſurance of a Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, will take off the fear of Death; a true believer that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the covenant with aſſurance of Faith, doth not put the day of Death far from him, as being loath to ſee it, and even affraid to think of it; no, but he deſires to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt; he knows that Death is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimus morborum medicus,</hi> that which cures all diſeaſes, cures the Pride, and Covetouſneſs, and Hardneſs,

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:137310:36"/>his God and Saviour for evermore.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The thoughts of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come will be ſweet to thoſe that have a known intereſt in the Covenant of Gods his love, for the Judge is their friend, their brother, their head, their husband, and the day of Judgment,<note place="margin">

            <p n="6">6. He that is certain of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Gods Covenant, is certain of his intereſt in Salvation, and ſo the thoughts of Heaven muſt needs be delightful to him while he is certain that it is the bleſſed reſt prepared for him, the place of his everlaſting abode in happineſs yea, this aſſurance gives the Soul a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion of Heaven, brings Heaven down (as I may ſay) into the boſom of a believer while he is upon Earth; Faith is the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus you ſee the benefit of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: ſome ſpecial advantages and comforts that thence accrue to the Soul, which ſhould be a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to put us upon care and pains to get it, doth it not bring a ſufficient reward with it? Doth not the profit and comfort that comes by it, far exceed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt profit in the World, and the greateſt comfort that Earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords?</p>
            <p>Therefore, though the Covenant may be ſavingly applyed by Faith, where aſſurance is not, yet let us ſtrive to aſſurance, that we may live and die comfortably, in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, his everlaſting love towards us in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you, how aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may be attained, and how it may be diſcerned from preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <note place="margin">Way to aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>1. Concerning the way and means to attain aſſurance.</p>
            <p>We muſt be much in exerciſing and acting all Grace, muſt be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in trading with our ſtock of Grace, that we may attain to the riches of aſſurance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2.</note> as the Apoſtle calls it; <hi>The diligent hand maketh rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may have comfort and aſſurance, we muſt beware of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and ſluggiſhneſs, and lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in duty, and of remiſſeneſs in the exerciſe and actings of Grace. True is that which a reverend Doctor (now with God) hath told us in a Treatiſe of his. <q>That it is the lazie Chriſtian commonly that wants aſſurance: and, that the way of painful dutie is the way of fulleſt comfort.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sloth and idleneſs ſtops the fountain of comfort, cauſeth Chriſt to with-hold his comforts; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are not wont to ſmile, but frown upon their Children, when they are negligent and careleſs of their duty, and neglective of their obſervance toward them.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:137310:38"/>
            <p>All the honour that God hath from us, is from the exerciſe and actings of Grace; and the more we ſtrive to honour God, the more will he comfort us with the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of himſelf, and the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his love in our hearts; Active Chriſtians ſhall have moſt of Gods love, and of the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his Grace to them; <hi>He that hath my Commandements,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Again, ſloath and negligence cauſeth want of peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for this reaſon, becauſe Grace is not ſenſible, apparent, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Soul, but in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and actings of it; as the fire that is in the flint is not diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, till you ſmite and force it out: In acting Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt, and the promiſes of God, and in acting love toward God and Chriſt, you will know that you have the grace of Faith and Love; will know that ye believe, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:137310:38"/>that ye love God, and ſo will know that God loveth you; for we love God becauſe he loved us firſt, and our believing is a fruit of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt be much in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Covenant with a faith of adherence and innitency, cleaving to the promiſes, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves by Faith through Chriſt, upon the mercy and grace of a Covenanting God, till the love and grace of God be revealed from faith to faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt take heed that we do not greive, but pleaſe the ſpirit of God, the Comforter, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth the love of the Father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Souls, and ſealeth them up to the day of Redemption; The way to aſſurance of Gods love, is to comply with, and give content to the witneſſing ſealing Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we deſire, that God ſhould beſtow upon us the riches of full aſſurance; then, let us be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the leaſt glimps of Light, that he maketh to ſhine into us; let us not look at any of the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:137310:39"/>of God, as ſmall, but let us be thankful for any pledge of his favour.</p>
            <p>The Lord in making out his love to the Soul, deals (ſaith one) as <hi>Boaz</hi> dealt with <hi>Ruth:</hi> he firſt gave her liberty to glean in his fields, then to glean even among the ſheaves, then invited her to eat bread with him, and to dip her morſels in the vinegar, and at laſt; he took her to be his Wife, to lye in his boſome: ſo doth God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his love to believers, firſt, more ſparingly, and as at greater diſtance, then draws nearer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals himſelf more clearly, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf more friendly to them, and familiar with them; and then at length he gives his Spirit into their boſom, to aſſure them of his love, and of their intereſt in all his grace.</p>
            <p>Now the ready way to attain all this, to have ſuch manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods love to us, is to be truly thankful for the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Grace; Then will God ſay to ſuch a Soul, art thou ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:137310:39"/>thankful for a beam of Light, I will fill thee with the fountain of Light; art thou thus thankful for crumbs that fall under the board? I will feaſt thee with marrow and fatneſs at my Table.</p>
            <p n="5">5. One other great means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to a certainty of our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Gods Covenant, is a ſerious trial of our hearts, and of the ſtate of our Souls, by and according to the Word of God: the Scripture tells us, who are the people of God, his Covenanted ones, what are their qualifications and properties; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us ſee what the Scripture holds forth in this point, and then let us diligently prove our ſelves, whether we be ſuch perſons, ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, that by this means we may come to a certainty of our eſtate.</p>
            <p>Now for direction herein (to make ſhort work of it) know this, that where holineſs is, there is the Covenant of God his love: —<hi>Holy, Beloved;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12.</note> all holy Souls are beloved of God; prove your ſelves then whether there be a true work of Grace wrought in you by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:137310:40"/>of God, whether you are of the number of Gods holy ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> How may this be known? who are holy ones?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Where corruption is by Grace ſo far ſubdued, that ſin reigns not, there is holineſs; when a Soul is delivered (not wholly from ſin, that will not be in this life? but) from the law of ſins, ſo that ſin hath not dominion over him; The Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12.</note>
               <hi>Let not ſin reign in your mortal bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſt thereof:</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>ne ſit,</hi> let not ſin be in you (though we muſt not allow it in our ſelves, or ſuffer it to be quiet) but <hi>ne regnat,</hi> let not ſin reign in you.</p>
            <p>Sin reigneth when it hath the wil's conſent, &amp; the hearts delight, and commands the whole man: when a man is a willing ſervant of ſin, and (as the Apoſtle ſaith) yields his members weapons of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto ſin, is in a readineſs to obey ſins commands, and to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the luſts of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Sin cannot be ſaid to reign, when
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:137310:40"/>a man doth unwilling ſervice to ſin, bewailes and hates the evil that is in him, and the evil that is done by him, and wars againſt ſin, and prays againſt Sin, and deſires and endeavours to ſhake off the yoke of ſin; I ſay, here ſin cannot properly be ſaid to reign; though it exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Tyrannical power, forcing a poor ſoul many times to do its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and where this reign of ſin is not, there is holineſs, but where ſin reigneth there is no Saintſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that is univerſal and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his deſires to be good, and do good, having reſpect to all Gods commands; that truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be filled with the knowledg of Gods will, in all wiſdome and ſpiritual underſtanding, and to walk worthy of the Lord unto all well pleaſing, and to be fruitful in every good work; that deſires and endeavours to order his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright, in the fear of God, and to keep his Conſcience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence toward God, and toward men, to be conformed to the mind of God in internal, as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:137310:41"/>holineſs, and righteouſneſs, he is a holy man, though he may have many infirmities falling ſhort of his duty, and doing oft times that which is diſpleaſing to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If a man be ſincerely diligent in uſing the means of Grace, ſetting his heart to ſeek God in them, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the profiting and perfecting of himſelf by them, and bewailing his unprofitableneſs and barrenneſs under them, ſuch a perſon is to be numbred among holy ones; true deſires of Grace, and cadeavours to get Grace, are a ſign of the truth of Grace; but where the means of Grace are ſlighted and neglected, and God is not ſonght unto for Grace, there is no Grace, no work of Holineſs yet wrought in the Soul; for Grace is ſuch a good thing, ſuch a precious thing, and Holineſs is ſo deſirable, ſo comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and delightful, that he who hath any thing of it, deſires more, and thinks that he can never have enough. Well, thus prove your real, ſpiritual eſtate, that hereby
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:137310:41"/>you may come to a knowledge of your relative eſtate: This is the way to aſſurance of an intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Gods love: Thus much briefly, touching the way to aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the means by which it may be attained.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>Labour truiy and thorowly to apply the Covenant, ſtrive to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of your ſpiritual eſtate real and relative, to know whether you belong to God or no, and whether the Covenant of his love doth belong to you.</p>
            <p>Take two or three ſwaſives or incentives hereunto,<note place="margin">Incentives.</note> beſides thoſe which you have had already.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Miſtakes herein are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; for ſuch a miſtake of ones condition judging it to be good, when it is naught, is a very great ſtrengthner of ſin, making a man regardleſs of bettering his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cauſing him to miſapply Scripture to apply promiſes and comforts, when threatnings and terrours belong to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The commoneſt cauſe of ſouls undoing is this, that they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:137310:50"/>would not be perſwaded to try their eſtate, but gratifie Satan, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him to deceive themſelves being perſwaded by him to paſs a way their years in ſecurity and a careleſs oſcitancy, not once queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning their condition, or ſpending any time at all, to prove what their eſtate is Godward; if any man think himſelf to be ſomething when he is nothing, be deceives himſelf, and this ſelf deceiving is ſelf-undoing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A certain knowledge of a Covenant intereſt in God, will ſet the ſoul on working ſweetly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, with its affections and graces.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such a ſoul will ſorrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a godly ſort, bewailing his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God, whom he now knows to be his God, who dearly and tenderly loved him, even while he was ſinning againſt him, and diſhonouring him.</p>

                  <hi>Counſ. 5.</hi> Meditate on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> having laid hold on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Meditate on it, and on your
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:137310:51"/>intereſt in it, that frequently and ſeriouſly viewing your relative eſtate, your relation to God, and intereſt in his Covenant, you may be deeply affected with it, and enjoy the ſweetneſs of it.</p>
            <p>This is that which I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to; not only to think of this Covenant, and of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in it, of the preciouſneſs of the Covenant, and of the ſouls happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuch an intereſt; (it is not a bare work of the underſtanding and memory that is here called for) but to get theſe things from the head to the heart, from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the affections, that there may be heart as well as life in the ſoul; that by acting our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and affections upon the Covenant, and upon God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us we may have a ſweet enjoyment of him.</p>
            <p>To Meditate, is diligently and intently to think upon, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a thing.</p>
            <p>Meditation brings God near, ſets him full in the eye of the ſoul, and preſents him with his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:137310:51"/>of Grace in the moſt afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way; ſerious and deep medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will draw up arguments to affect us, from every Attribute of God, and from the conſideration of our former eſtate, when we were without God in the World, and without Chriſt, and without Hope, and from the happines of our preſent eſtate, in having and apprehending the Lord to be our God, and from the preciouſneſs of the promiſes in which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed, and from the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant, and from the preſent fruits of it, and its future priviledges and advantages.</p>
            <p>Thus Meditation is a means to affect the ſoul with the goodneſs, and ſweetneſs of the Covenant, that we may take much comfort in it.</p>
            <p>And further, a due diligent, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meditation of the power and wiſdom, and mercifulneſs, and faithfulneſs, and ſatisfactorineſs of God, in whom we have intereſt through Chriſt, of his everlaſting love toward us, and of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:137310:52"/>of his grace, in making a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us, becoming our God and taking us to be his people, and of the riches of his grace held forth to us in the Covenant of Promiſe; and the conſideration of the tender love of Jeſus Chriſt, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to be the Mediator of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for us, reconciling us to God by his Death, making peace for us by his Bloud, bearing the Curſe which ſhould have come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and reſtoring us to the bleſſing which we had loſt, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing for us eternal Salvation, pleading his Bloud with his Father, and making continual interceſſion for us, that we may be kept in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, notvvithſtanding our many ſins and provocations, vvho is become our head, and the immortal husband of our ſouls, vvho kiſſeth us vvith the kiſſes of his mouth, and embraceth us novv in the armes of his love, and vvill take us to a perpetual abode and Communion vvith himſelf hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I ſay, a due Meditation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vvould be a means to ſtirr up in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:137310:52"/>us holy affection toward God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This would be a means to enflame us with holy love to God and Chriſt, who have loved us with ſuch a free, preventing, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, abounding, fruitful, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This would be a means to excite deſire, and to ſet the Soul on longing for a nearer uninterrupted communion with, and a fuller en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of this God, and this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that my Soul may be no longer at a diſtance from my God, but that I may dwell with him for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will be an excellent means to quicken and ſtrengthen hope; I ſay, hope of all needful bleſſings here, and of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hereafter; Is the Lord my God, and ſhall I not hope? Have I God's Promiſe, and Oath, and ſhall I not hope? Is not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God ſo ſure, that hope therein maketh not aſhamed? Therefore in wants, and ſtraights, and difficulties, and in my greateſt ſufferings, I will ſay with the

            <p n="4">4. A diligent, ſerious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's Covenant and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it, will raiſe our joy; God hath made with me a Covenant of Peace, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now (by the way) from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of the Covenant, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the worth of the things promiſed in it, and the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the comforts that flow from it; I infer this, That the worſt of a believer, is better than the beſt of an unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; or,</p>
            <p>That the loweſt eſtate of one interreſted in the Covenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is better than the moſt raiſed condition of any one that is unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terreſted in it, and a ſtranger to it.</p>
            <p>A believer may be a ſtranger in the world, and afflicted with want of food and cloathing convenient,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:137310:55"/>and may meet with a great deal of hard uſuage; yet, he is a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of the Heavenly Jeruſalem; he is the Lords Free-man, he hath God for his Father, Jeſus Chriſt is his Brother; and though he hath little or nothing at preſent to the eye of the World, yet he is rich in hope; though he hath nothing in poſſeſſion viſible, he hath a rich Inheritance, a Kingdom, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Crown in reverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Who is the better man? the poor Chriſtian whom God hath choſen to be rich in Faith, heire to a Kingdom, to the Kingdom of Heaven? or the rich and honoured Worldling, that wears a Gold-ring, and hath the higheſt room given him in the Aſſmblies? ſurely there is no happineſs like to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a believer, that hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant of Grace, the Lord is his God, this is the Crown of all enjoyments, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of all happineſs.</p>
            <p>Whence it follows, that God is to be praiſed by us, for nothing in

            <p>But, now the comforts which faith doth fetch from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are ſtreams iſſuing from a living Fountain, that is always yeilding out, they are day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and night-comforts, ſummer-comforts, and winter comforts, to ſupport and refreſh the Soul in the night of trouble, and the winter of adverſity; as well as in the day of outward peace, and ſummer of proſperity: Gods Covenant is an everlaſting Covenant which yields everlaſting comfort to thoſe that are intereſted in it: and if a Soul that hath an intereſt in it, do at any time, or in any caſe want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from it, it is for want of a lively acting of faith upon it.</p>

            <p n="5">5. To urge one argument more, that may perſwade to the acting of faith upon the Covenant.</p>
            <p>This will be a notable means of making a ſweet and happy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our intereſt in the Covenant: I ſhall ſhew this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

            <p n="2">2. By thus acting faith upon the Covenant, which God hath given us, we ſhall be ſweetly emboldned in our requeſts to God, <q>O Lord I come to thee now in a weighty caſe, and in my great neceſſity, to implore thy goodneſs toward me, and why ſhould not I with an humble boldneſs approach to the Throne of thy Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident of acceptance through Chriſt, ſeeing thou art

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. By acting Faith upon the Covenant, and by a frequent believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recognition of our intereſt in God, we ſhall be enabled to bear afflictions patiently, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go them with chearfullneſs. The
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:137310:65"/>ſting of afflictions, and the burden of the Croſs is the apprehenſion of Gods anger in it, but while this perſwaſion is kept up in the Soul, that God is my God, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of his love is with me; here is a ſurpaſſing, comforting conſideration in the greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <q>Surely my God means me no harm, he intends no evil to me in this, he hath promiſed that all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for my good, while he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts me, he is my God ſtill, he threatens me, and loves me ſtill, it is all for my profit; I know that in faithfullneſs he afflicteth me, all Gods ways are mercy and truth to his Covenanted ones; O my Soul, lye quietly under the red, chear up under his affliction, it is a fathers rod, it is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of my God.</q>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe when Creature-comforts that are the Conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes conveighing Gods goodneſs to us, are cut off, faith goes to the Fountain, and drinks there, The believing ſoul makes God its por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:137310:66"/>and finding all in him, is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him; this is the excellent skill &amp; ſingular art of faith, thus to ſupply wants, and ſo to bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment by taking up all in God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith in Gods Covenant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the believer with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal full bleſſing of the Covenant, and gives it into the boſom of the ſoul, faith gives the ſoul a light of Heaven, and ſets the Crown, the everlaſting inheritance before the believer.<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. There is in God likewiſe a ſufficiency of Goodneſs, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to put forth his wiſdom and power for his peoples good. Truly, God is good to Iſrael: the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">

               <hi>for thy word hath quickned me.</hi> When the believer is damped in ſpirit, and as it were dead in regard of ſpiritual operations and affections, faith reviveth him drawing lift out of the word of promiſe, from the Covenant of God. Though it be thus, and thus with me, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant; The ſence hereof doth not only ſupport the ſoul, but rejoyce it; The ſoul is comforted againſt ſin and Satan, and death, and Hell, and amidſt ſorrows, and afflictions in the world, when a Chriſtian remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth what he hath in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and how he ſtands related to God; and are theſe conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God ſmall?</p>

            <p n="10">10. A lively acting of faith upon the Covenant, will raiſe the Chriſtian to heavenly mindedneſs, to have his heart much in heaven with his God, who is his portion and his treaſure; when faith reads the love, and goodneſs, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of God, as he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf in the lines of the Covenant, and gives the ſoul a true account of it, now the ſoul muſt needs love, where it is thus loved, and where there is ſuch lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, for this is attractive of love; Now, <hi>anima eſt ubi amat,</hi> the heart, the ſoul is where it loveth; if the treaſure be in Heaver, there will the heart be; therefore if we would have our hearts to be in Heaven, let us keep them ſtill poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with true believing thoughts and apprehenſions of the free, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding grace and love of God toward us, expreſſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

            <p>Now there are two general parts of the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note>1. An argument of God his ſurpaſſing love toward the elect, that he gave his own Son to dye for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A moſt comfortable infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereupon, that having giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Son, he will give all things with him.</p>
            <p>The words being opened, the Text gives us many doctrines.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Doctrines deducted.</note>1. That Jeſus Chriſt (who is here called Gods own Son) is very God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Son of God was given by God for the ranſome of ſouls.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That God did not give his Son, nor did Jeſus Chriſt give himſelf to dye for all, but only for the Elect.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the love of God is wonderfully made out to ſouls in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:137310:85"/>giving his Son to dye for them.</p>
            <p>Theſe four obſervations lye ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear in the antecedent, <hi>viz.</hi> that God ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up to death for the Elect.</p>
            <p>Now in the conſequent or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, [that God will ſurely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Chriſt give all other things) we have theſe notes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That even all earthly things are given and diſpenſed by God.<note place="margin">Doctrines.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That Jeſus Chriſt is the great gift of God,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That where God giveth Chriſt, he will give all other need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful good things.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all the enjoyments of believers are gifts of grace; where Chriſt is given, there is (a gracious) gifts of other things with him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Where Chriſt is not given, nothing is given with a purpoſe of grace.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That where the love of God in giving Chriſt, is apprehended and particularly applied, there faith hath ſure footing to ſtand and bear up the ſoul in expectation of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:137310:85"/>all other needful good things, (This comes up to the ſcope of the Text.)</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, this 32th verſe of this 8th Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> is like a ſpecial branch of a fruitful tree, ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well loaden with precious fruit, yielding us many uſeful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:137310:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>that here is ſuppoſed and implied.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſuppoſed, that this Son of God was made Man; here is a neceſſary ſuppoſition of the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God; for as God he could not dye; the divine nature is impaſſible: The Word therefore muſt be made fleſh, the Son of God muſt become Man, that he might be capable of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſinners, who were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by his death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is neceſſarily implied the union of two natures in the perſon of Chriſt; he was both God and Man; therefore he is called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us: and hence it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> that God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed his Church with his owe bloud; Chriſt, as God had no bloud to ſhed, and conſidered as a mear man his bloud could not be a valuable price for the redemption of ſouls; he muſt be man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might be in a capacity to dye, and he muſt be God, that his death might be ſatisfactory and meritorious.</p>
            <p>Now to the point, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,

            <p>And ſuch redemption is either corporal, or ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt his redemption is not corporal, but ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>Man before he finned had ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual liberty; this being loſt by ſin, there comes in the room of it guilt, and a ſpiritual captivity; partly under the wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Judge, and the curſe of the Law, partly under ſpiritual enemies, ſin, devil, death, and hell.</p>
            <p>Now there is a ſpiritual redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given, the mediator Chriſt Jeſus, and a ſpiritual price or ranſome paid, the death of Chriſt, which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:137310:88"/>however according to the hiſtory it was corporal, yet in reſpect of the end of it, is wholly ſpiritual; and the fruits and benefits of this redemption are ſpiritual, <hi>viz.</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the wrath of God, and the curſe of the Law, and the power of Satan, death, and hell; remiſſion of ſins, adoption, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and eternal ſalvation; and in our doctrine, we ſay, it is the redemption of ſouls.</p>
            <p>This is the redemption that is in Chriſt, or by Chriſt, purchaſed; procured, effected by his death, which was ſatisfactory to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God (ſo that upon account hereof God is ready to releaſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from his curſe and wrath, and the puniſhment due for ſin) and deſtructive to the Devil's power and kingdome; ſo that in reſpect of Satan, the Redeemer fetcheth of his poor captives from him by ſtrong hand, an almighty power. Thus the redemption that we are ſpeaking of is the vindication or recovery of ſinners, from the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in which they were under ſin,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:137310:88"/>Satan, death, and the wrath of God, into the contrary ſpiritual li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by the payment of a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent price, which was the bloud of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Yet let me add a word more concerning this redemption.</p>
            <p>As there is a twofold adoption pointed out in Scripture, the one inchoat, whereby we are made the Sons of God; the other conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, whereby we are manifeſted to be the Sons of God, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a full poſſeſſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Sons, (which adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sons of God are ſaid to wait for) ſo there is a twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>

               <p>Is bread uſefull, is water uſeful, is wine uſefull, is rayment uſefull, is a tender father, or a good husband or wife, or a towardly hopefull off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, a bleſſing and a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enjoyment, why of more uſe, of more concernment, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               <p>Now it is good for us to note the fulneſs and the freeneſs of the conveighance of mercies and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings made to us in and through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is a full conveighance, the fullneſs that was put into the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the mediator, was all for poor ſouls, that of his fulnes we might receive, grace for grace,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:137310:104"/>and there is through him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighance of all things pertaining to life and godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There is a free conveighance of Gods bounty to us through Chriſt Jeſus, how ſhall he not with him (freely) give us all things If the firſt gift were free, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſories muſt be free alſo; but the firſt gift was free, whether we look to the decree or the execution, what was there to move God to appoint his Son to be mediator, and to ſend him in the fulneſs of time to work out the redemption of ſinners, ſurely nothing unleſs it were the creatures miſery.</p>

               <p n="1">1. An argument from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the leſſer, concludeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in reaſon, but the concluſion made by faith, is neceſſary in this caſe, if we look to Chriſt as heire of all things, upon whom all is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now if Jeſus Chriſt be ſuch a comprehenſive gift, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing gift, and ſuch an enga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging gift, then he is the principa gift of God, a gift above all other gifts,</p>

               <p n="2">2. If Chriſt be the conveying gift of God, then we muſt ſeek all good from God in and through Chriſt, and give thanks to God by Chriſt, for all the good that we receive; God beſtoweth in and through Jeſus Chriſt, all that he giveth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and in a way of love, and ſo God receiveth all from us in the way of duty and ſervice by the hand of Chriſt, So that we muſt have mind upon Jeſus Chriſt, and

               <p n="3">3. If Chriſt be the engaging gift of God, and if we reckon that God hath beſtowed his ſon upon us, and ſo (as it were) bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to give us all other need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful good things, then there is an engagement upon us, to give our ſelves back unto God; it is contrary to Religion and reaſon, that we ſhould think to be looſe from God, and yet to have him bound to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are informed hence, who are the richeſt men and women, ſurely they are believers, ſuch as enjoy Chriſt; for though ſuch may be ſometimes in a poor outward condition, yet they cannot want any thing that is neceſſary for their Spiritual and Eternal welfare, and having Chriſt, they have that which can ſupply all wants, that which can ſatisſie the Soule; When <hi>Paul</hi> was come to Chriſt, then he had learned in what ſoever eſtate he was, therewith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;</p>

Now Chriſt is a conveyance beyond all convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, in him, by him, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, God conveyeth all things pertaining to life and godlineſs, makes over Heaven and Earth to us, all things are ours if Chriſt be ours; Ah what fools ſhall we prove our ſelves to be, if we ſlight the offers of Chriſt?</p>

               <p>This we may be ſure of, if God hath once given us Chriſt; for God doth not love to day and hate to morrow, but having once loved, he loveth to the end; If the firſt, the great gift were a gift of grace, ſo are all the reſt, they all flow from one Fountain, <hi>viz.</hi> the love and Grace of God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. You muſt be convinced of your ſpiritual poverty, nakedneſs, and miſery of your loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done condition without Chriſt, that ſo you may be prepared for him, being taken off from other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from reſting on any thing elſe: you muſt ſee the need you have of Chriſt, that you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him, and may be ready to reach out the hand of the Soul, to receive him, when he is offered to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt be perſwaded of the worth of Jeſus Chriſt, believe his excellency,<note place="margin">Ignoti nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la cupido.</note> that he is valuable above all other things, that ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be carried to him, and that you may be willing to take this gift of God, as he is willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it: Oh, if ſouls were once otherwiſe perſwaded of the deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Chriſt, and of the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:137310:116"/>of Chriſt, and of the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in him, and did duly weigh his excellencies, then they would account all things loſt for Chriſt and would eſteem all things as dung that they may win Chriſt, and would cry out with that bleſſed Mar, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Think often and ſeriouſly upon Chriſt, what he is, and of what advantage to ſouls, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and Righteouſneſs, and Grace, and Glory come vvith him, and by him, let this I ſay be often thought upon, and probably by this means the ſoul may be vvrought upon to look more after Chriſt, and the heart may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to cloſe vvith him, this means hath been ſucceſsful, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. there is a ſpeech of the exaltation of Chriſt in the hearts of People, and an intimation of the means by vvhich they ſhould be vvrought to entertain ſuch high thoughts of Chriſt; that vvhich had not been told them,<note place="margin">

               <p n="4">4. If you have any apprehenſion of the excellencie of Chriſt, and any deſire to enjoy him, then you muſt be willing to take him upon God's termes, muſt let go ſelf, let go the World, let go Luſts, let go Pleaſures and Profits, when any of theſe ſtand in competition with Chriſt, muſt part with all for Chriſt; The Merchant man that will have the Pearle of great price, muſt ſel all to make purchaſe of that. All muſt be ſold in our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in our affection; and in reſpect of our confidence, and in reſpect of a full reſignation of all up unto God, ſo that we muſt not ſet a high price upon theſe worthleſs things, muſt not cleave in affection to them, muſt not truſt in theſe things,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:137310:117"/>muſt be willing to let go al, when God will have it from us; and ſ rely there is nothing loſt by exchanging all other things for Chriſt, if all worldly traſh go for this true Treaſure it ſhould be no ill bargaine; It is better to be with out all other things then to be without Chriſt; and it muſt needs be a great gain to get Chriſt, with the loſs of other things; becauſe God hath trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up all riches in him, and hath appointed him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all other things, yea and far better then all other enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>But now people ſtick at this; when Chriſt &amp; ſelf, Chriſt &amp; luſts, Chriſt and pleaſures, Chriſt and profits ſtand in competition; ſo that if they vvill have Chriſt they muſt let go theſe things, they like not to deal upon ſuch tearmes: They ſee not ſo much in Chriſt, as they do in other things, therefore they will not be perſwaded to part from theſe things for Chriſt,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:137310:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>many are kept off from Chriſt by a conceit of ſelf wiſdome and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and by carnal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and advantages in the World, and by the love of luſts, ſo that they are ready to ſay, as thoſe Trees in the Parable,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.</note>

               <p>O friends, if you will have Chriſt you muſt be reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the termes, to part from all for him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You muſt ſeek Jeſus Chriſt, in the uſe of thoſe means which God hath appointed and afforded, particularly, in attendance upon the Miniſtery of the word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God maketh offers of Grace, and holdeth forth Jeſus Chriſt with his fulneſ to you, if you will receive him; God will be ſound of thoſe that ſeek him; Chriſt will come to thoſe that wait for him in his own way.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:137310:119"/>in the way to find Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As you muſt attend upon Ordinances, that you may finde Chriſt in them, ſo you muſt heed God his offers of Chriſt, and Chriſt his tenders of himſelf to you; You muſt obſerve how Chriſt comes to you in the ſweet motions of the Spirit, knocking at the doors of your heart, and importuning you to open to him; <hi>Iſtand at the doore and knock, if any man open to me, I will come in to him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reve. 3.26</note> Chriſt ſpeaketh in the Miniſtrie of the Goſpel, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you to faith and repentance, and new obedience, and he knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the doores of your hearts by the motions of his Spirit, and this ſtanding and knocking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an carneſt deſire to be let in, to be entertained; Now vvhen vve repent and believe, and give Chriſt enterance into our hearts, this is to open the doore unto him; Oh, take heed you do not neglect the calls and knocks of Chriſt, but open to him; let the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doores of your ſoules be lifted up, that the King Glory may come
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:137310:119"/>in. Oh, how long have you kept Chriſt out of doore? though he hath knocked hard, and called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, yet he could not hitherto obtain to have the doore opened to him, you would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to caſt the World out of your hearts, and to turn out luſts, and take him in; but ſtill continue as vain, as proud, as worldly, as intemperate, as irreligious, and every way as bad as you were? O firs, take heed of reſiſting the Spirit, of giving Chriſt ſuch often repulſes, leaſt he be provoked to be gone, and reſolve not to ſollicite you any further, that his Spirit ſhall not more ſtrive with you, leſt you be given up to your own counſels, to periſh by your own gainſayings; Dear ſoules, give Chriſt entertainment; Oh, that the power of Goſpel Revelations and Goſpel Counſels may come in upon your hearts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How ſhall I know that I have Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Anſw. In order to a ſolution of this, or to give ſatisfaction herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall in general acquaint you with this.</p>
               <p>Our having received Chriſt; our being in Chriſt, and Chriſt his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us; are notions that ſerve to expreſs one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, I ſhall propound two heads, or tvvo vvaies of diſcoverie for anſwer to the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">If Chriſt be ours then we are in Chriſt.</note>1. If vve have received Chriſt, then we are in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now I find, that the Spirit of God uſeth a threefold compariſon or ſimilitude in ſetting forth a Believer his being in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Chriſtian is in Chriſt as a branch in the ſtock; ſo that if we bud and bloſſome, and grow in grace, &amp; be fruitful in holineſs, this
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:137310:120"/>is an agrument, that we have received Chriſt, that vve are in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Chriſtan is in Chriſt as a member in the bodie, united to the head; ſo that if there be Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life in us, and Spiritual ſenſe, and Spiritual motion and action; this is an argument, that vve have received Chriſt, that vve are in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Chriſtian his being in Chriſt, is ſet forth by the marriage vnion, ſo that if there be a ſweet intercourſe betvvene Chriſt and the ſoule, if the ſoule receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from Chriſt, and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his company and delight in communion with him, then he hath Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a man hath received Chriſt, then Chriſt is in him;<note place="margin">Chriſt is in us.</note> Chriſt is in the Saints, as the ſoule in the body, as the Sun in the World, as a man in his houſe, as a King on his Throne.</p>
               <p>Novv there are tvvo meanes, or tvvo manner of waies by which Chriſt is thus in the Saints, both
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:137310:121"/>expreſſed by the Apoſtle in one place, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit and Faith;</p>
               <p>The Believer's vnion with Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16, 17.</note> is not a natural mixture of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of Chriſt his ſubſtance, and our ſubſtance, as if there were a real entrance of the body or Soule of Chriſt, into our body or Soule.</p>
               <p>Nor is it onely a conjunction of love, or an union in affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Chriſt; but it is a miſtical union, in vvhich Chriſt-and Believers become one; Chriſt ſtians are knit to briſt and to one-another by joynts and bonds,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>col</hi> 2.19.</note> (The Spirit and faith are thoſe bonds) and this union is (as hath been ſaid) ſhadovved out in Scripture by the union of the head and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the body of man, and by the vnion of a man and a vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a married eſtate; This vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made on Chriſt his part, by his Spirit, on our part, by Faith.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is our Reconciliation, taking away all enmitie betwixt God and us, and making us accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:137310:128"/>

               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is to the ſoul that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth him, Wiſdome, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is in us to make us wiſe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3.</note> giving us the knowledg of God, enabling us to underſtand in ſome good meaſure the miſteries of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he maketh us Righteous, in putting his own Righteouſneſs to us, and juſtifying us thereby, he maketh us Holy, Sanctifying us by his Spirit, and he will make us compleatly happie in the end, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering us from all the miſeries to which we are ſubject in this life, and tranſlating us from death to life Eternal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Chriſt be in us, dwelling in our hearts by Faith, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us by his Spirit, then all the promiſes of God are in him, yea and amen to us, then we have
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:137310:129"/>the earneſt of all the Spirit, and all ſealed to us by the Spirit, which is given us.</p>
               <p>You know the uſe of a Seal, it is obligatorie on the one part, and ſerveth for aſſurance on the other part.</p>
               <p>You know the meaning of an Earneſt, it bindeth a promiſe; As it is part of the price to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the ſum promiſed, So, it is a pledge of a full perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Chriſt in us is a Seal, and an Earneſt, ſerving to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that we ſhall in due time receive through Chriſt, all that good which God hath promiſed for his ſake to give to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Chriſt be in us, his Grace is ſufficient for us in every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtrengthen us, and to give a good iſſue to make us victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and in every evil that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us, to ſupport us under it, and to deliver us from it, and to make our Conſolations to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, as our ſufferings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>

                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:137310:129"/>5. This is a very great prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which the ſoul hath by Chriſt dwelling in it, he woundeth and weakneth corruption, and frees the ſoul from the do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin; maketh the Soul alive unto God, ſets it at liberty to walk with God, and to run the way of his comandments, gives it a freedome unto righteouſneſs: here is a freedome indeed, when the ſoul is thus made free by Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God; <hi>If the Son make you free,</hi>

                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36.</note> 
                  <hi>then ſhall ye be free indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, this is accounted a great priviledge indeed by thoſe who are ſenſible of the grievouſneſs of that bondage in which they were held under corruption, when ſin did reign and bear full ſway in them, by thoſe who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſweetneſs and preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that freedome which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt bringeth unto ſoules; by thoſe who have proved the glory of this liberty into which ſoules are brought by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:137310:130"/>
               <p>What a baſe, vile, wretched condition is a man in, while the Devil is Lord Paramont to him, when every ſtinking luſt hath power over him, and full command of him.</p>
               <p>What a happineſs then is it, to have the Devil's yoke broken from off his neck, to be freed from ſin, to have his ſpirit ſweetly ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Jeſus Chriſt, to have his will determined to that which is good, and bound over to Righteouſneſs, to have the whole man given up unto God; though none knowes the miſery of the one, or the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the other, but they who have experienced both.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Where Chriſt is given, there is a gracious gift of other things with him.</p>
               <p>God doth not deal out his gifts to all men, graciouſly, and in good will, to ſome he giveth in diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and for evil to them, giveth health and ſtrength, giveth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, giveth gract parts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, giveth riches and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of theſe outward things,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:137310:130"/>but beſtoweth none of theſe things in love: but here is comfort for a ſoul that hath made ſure of Chriſt, he may look upon other matters, dealt out to him by the hand of Providence, as gifts of God's good will; as gracious diſpenſations; That which a child of God hath of the World, though it be but little in it ſelf, yet is much with the love of God in it, and upon account of his bleſſing with it, thus that of <hi>David</hi> holds excellently and eminently true:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16</note> 
                  <hi>A little that the righteous man hathis better then great Reverenues of the wicked,</hi> then the riches of any wicked.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Eternal life is the gift of God beſtowed in and with Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that he who now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth Chriſt by Faith, and hath him dwelling in him by his Spirit, hath aſſurance given him that he ſhall poſſeſs glory with him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Now friends, Is not Chriſt worth the looking after, is not he above all things to be ſought? Chriſt our Reconciliation, taking
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:137310:131"/>away all enmity betwixt God and us? Chriſt that becomes to us, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption by whom we are enlightned, iuſtified, ſanctified and glorified. Chriſt, in whom the promiſes of God are yea and amen to us, who will be to us (if we have him) as a ſeale and an earneſt, to aſſure us, that we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all that good which is carried in them? Chriſt that will ſupport us in every temptation, and trial, and be a comfort to us in every condition? hriſt that will be the death of ſin in us, and will bring in the life of Grace into us; that will bring ſuch a happy liberty to us, making us of Satans ſlaves to become the Lord's freemen; Chriſt with whom other things are given, and that graciouſly, in love and good will; Chriſt that will bring us into the boſome of God, to live with him for ever in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Is not this Chriſt, I ſay worth the looking after, wherfore, let your aim be at Chriſt; and above all
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:137310:131"/>things labour to get him, to be poſſeſſed of him, and to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that he is yours, and you are his.</p>
               <p>You invite friends to come to your houſes, and tell them, that you ſhall be glad of their company, and ready to give them the beſt entertainment that the houſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, and heartio welcome; (though oft times, with ſome perſons, this is but a complement) Ah beloved; do you in reality invite Chriſt to come to your ſoules; entreat him to come and dwell with you, in you; Tell him that he ſhall have the command of every roome in thy heart, the whole houſe of thy ſoule ſhall be at his diſpoſing, that all the faculties of thy ſoul and all the members of thy bodie ſhall be at his his ſervice; thus begg of him, woe him, to come and make his abode with thee; and in the vſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and in Duties, wait for his comming to thee, and when he ſhall come and knock be ready according
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:137310:132"/>to thy invitation to open the door of thy heart, and receive him in with joy; for ſurely, he will prove a good Gueſt indeed, that will feaſt thee with his love, and vvill fill thee vvith delights; and make even the worſt condition on Earth to be a very heaven to thee,</p>
               <p>Having urged theſe incentives to the ſeeking of Chriſt: I thought not to have proceeded any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in preſſing this Counſel, but for as much as I am now dealing with people about a buſineſs, that is of the greateſt concernment to them, and becauſe I know that ſouls are not eaſily prevailed with in ſuch a caſe. I ſhall begg a little more of the Reader's patience, while I make an eſſay for the driving of ſinners (if they will not yet be dravvn) unto Chriſt, and I think, that having a whip put into my hand by God, I muſt make ſome uſe of it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore now urg ſome conſiderations about the vvant of Chriſt, ſetting forth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie

               <p>Now Chriſtian, this Chriſt is thine, by whom thy ſins are taken away, through whom God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to thee, by whoſe bloud thou art cleanſed from thy ſin. Doth Satan come to winnow the ſoul by temptations, and vex it with accuſations, telling the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that he is thus and thus ſinful and guilty, and that the Law which he hath tranſgreſſed, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens death and damnation to him? what ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> for the believer his comfort in this caſe?<note place="margin">

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:137310:150"/>it is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died; yea, rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Who ſhall lay any thing to thy charge, if Chriſt clear thee? who or what ſhall condemn thee, ſeeing Chriſt (who is given to thee) hath died for thee, for thy ſins, and riſen again for thy juſtification, in as much as thou haſt by faith laid hold on Chriſt, who died, and roſe from the dead, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, making inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for thee? And further, this Chriſt is with thee, in thee, to ſtrengthen thee in temptations, that thy faith fail not, and that thou be not overcome of the evil one,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>houldſt and wouldſt do? why!
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:137310:151"/>now conſider, that Chriſt is thne for all ſauing purpoſes, for all ſoul advantages; he will be thy ſtrength, and ſhew his power in thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; his ſpirit is with thee, in thee, to help thine infirmities.</p>
               <p>Do outward troubles annoy thee? art thou in an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? why! Chriſt, whom the Father hath given to thee, gave himſelf for thee, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee from this preſent evil world; he is a covert from the tempeſt, as Rivers of waters in a dry place, as the ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land; he hath a fellow-feeling of thy ſufferings, and will not ſuffer thee to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above meaſure, and his grace is ſufficient for thee, to ſtrengthen, and ſupport, and comfort thee, in every affliction and tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ble, and to give thee a great advantage by it, cauſing ſweet to come out of the ſower, and meat out of the Eater, and in due time to deliver thee, wholly to deliver the burden from thy ſhoulders. So that believers may have (what our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:137310:151"/>to his Diſciples) peace and and comfort in Chriſt, when in the world they have tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Doth death look upon thee with a grim countenance, to put thee in fear? Now conſider that Chriſt who is thine, hath overcome Death for thee, and hath by his Death deſtroyed him that had the power of Death, hath delivered thee from the wrath to come, hath opened to thee the way to Heaven, and every gate of Heaven, he himſelf is the way, and the doore for thee to enter in by and he will be to thee the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and the life.</p>
               <p>Thus, if Chriſt be thine, he is thy Propitiation, thy Juſtification, thy Srength, thy Salvation: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let Faith carry thee to leane on him in all temptations and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that thou maiſt be borne up by him, and comforted with the thoughts of thy intereſt in him.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot thus leave this theam, but muſt add ſomething
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:137310:152"/>for a further amplification of the comfort of Believers, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As I have ſhewed you, that the having of Chriſt is to believers a firm ground of comfort, for Faith to pitch upon in all Spiritual and corporal inward and outward affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo I ſhall give you to ſee, how Chriſt is actually &amp; effectually a Comforter in ſuch caſes to thoſe that have received him.</p>
               <p>If the ſoul be afflicted with ſtrong temptations Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth it with this Word, My grace is ſufficient for thee, to keep thee from being overcome, and to make thee more then a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p>If Satan hath prevailed againſt the Chriſtian by temptation, and drawn him into ſome great ſin, whereupon there followeth ſoul affliction, when the conſcience is awakened; Then Chriſt comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoul, leading to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which is ſet open for ſin and for uncleanneſs, preſents to it the flowings of his Bloud, ſets before
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:137310:152"/>it the fulneſs and freeneſs of the Grace of God in Chriſt, for the pardon of all ſins, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of every weary ſoul, for the ſatisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If Chriſt for the trial of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian do hide himſelf from him, ſo that he is troubled and inwardly afflicted for want of the felt preſence of Chriſt, and for want of the manifeſtation of Chriſt his love to his ſoul, in this caſe Chriſt will be a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Comforter to the poor humbled ſoul, he that caſteth the ſoul down, will lift it up again, leading it by his Spirit to lay hold upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which lies for every child of God, in that of the Apoſtle, <hi>There is no temptation hath taken

                  <hi>For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee; In a litle wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment but with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kindneſs will I have mercy upon the, ſai h the Lord thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:</hi> And thus Chriſt returns in due time to receive the ſpirits of his humble ones.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in the believer is ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Comforter in all Spiritual diſtreſs, in all ſoul affliction.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe in caſe of outward trouble, and temporal diſtreſſeſs, Chriſt in heart is a Comforter, telling the Believer, that he is all ſufficient for him, tells him, that there is in him a ſufficiency of Wiſdom, to find out a way for his deliverance, and a ſufficiency of power, actually to accompliſh his deliverance, how great ſoever the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:137310:153"/>evil be that lies upon him, yea and a ſufficiencie of Love and grace, to make out his power and wiſdom for his good, and ſo comforteth him abundantly, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him with this perſwaſion, that all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to him.</p>
               <p>Here is the happineſs of a Believer, that he hath a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter in his boſome, in the midſt of all troubles.</p>
               <p>This is made out clearly in the experience of the Saints, of which I might give you ſundry Scripture inſtances, <hi>David</hi> in his ſoul trouble found Chriſt a Comforter.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> was by <hi>Herod</hi> caſt into priſon, was not Chriſt there a Comforter to him.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> fell maliciouſly and deſparately upon <hi>Stephen,</hi> and in their rage Stoned him, did not he receive then glorious comfort from Chriſt dwel ing in him? <hi>Paul</hi> found this to be true, at ſundry times, and in ſundry caſes: And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> together in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:137310:154"/>had experience of this truth. Where Chriſt is in the ſoul, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul to act faith upon him; he is actually a Comforter in all conditions, in every diſtreſs of ſoul and body.</p>
               <p>Well, now for a cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Chriſt brings with him all good to thoſe that enjoy him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have by Chriſt all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things, as much as is needful for them, and that which God ſees good for them to have; (now if a man hath what is for his neceſſary uſe, and ſo much as is for his good, is he not well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for?) and he that hath Chriſt, hath that which will make full amends for all ſeeming and conceited wants, that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better than thoſe things which God is pleaſed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from them; and Chriſt being in contentation to many pirits, ſo that in a poor
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:137310:154"/>outward eſtate, the believer is as well pleaſed, as if he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and ſo he hath all in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation; he that is content wants nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt bringeth ſpiritual good to the ſoul, bringing in the treaſures of grace, and the riches of conſolation (though to ſome ſoul he giveth more of that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, more of theſe riches, than he doth to others.) Chriſt is made to us ſanctification, he is the author and worker of grace and holineſs, ſo that the hearts in which Chriſt is, muſt needs be gracious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he giveth in wiſdome, and meekneſs, and love, and zeal, and other graces of the ſpirit, and he tells his Diſciples, (and all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in them) that he will not leave them comfortleſs. I am he that comforteth you, ſaith the Lord Chriſt.</p>
